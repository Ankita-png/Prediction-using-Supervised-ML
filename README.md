# Prediction-using-Supervised-ML

This is a task from the GRIP - The Sparks Foundation. The task is to predict the percentage score of a student based on the number of study hours of that particular student. This is a simple linear regression analysis task which involves only two variables. The given data consists of the Study Hours of a number of students with their respective Percentage Scores they have obtained in their exam. Hence using this data we can predict whether studying for more hours results in good percentage score in the exam or not.
